Technical Exam - Parking Allocation system (Unfinished)

- I was able to implement the proper allocation of car to parking slots logic but the allocation of the nearest parking slot distance is still not working/buggy.

- Total charges are based on the number of hours input from the car registration form. I made use of that design due to time constraints. The best implementation is to give the parking slot which is occupied a start date and then calculate the time duration after the car is unparked.
